Hello there!

I like `variables`.

He is a **bold** _Italian_ dog - of course he uses [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com). And not only that:

1. Pizza
2. Pasta
3. Burrata

:joy: :joy:

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.


Also:

* great visualisation
  * but not so great maybe?
* I'd do it anyway

# Advanced

## Math

I want inline equations like $\sum^N_i x_i^2$ which can be nice. But full equations are great too:

$$\sum^N_i y_i^3$$

Nice, huh?

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

## Code

Sometimes code is nice too:
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series([
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5
])

mean = data.mean()
print("The mean is {mean:.2f}")
```
