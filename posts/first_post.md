Hello there!

He is a **bold** _Italian_ dog - of course he uses [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com). And not only that:

## Math

I want inline equations like $\sum^N_i x_i^2$ which can be nice. But full equations are great too:

$$\sum^N_i y_i^3$$

Nice, huh?

## Code

Sometimes code is nice too:
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series([
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5
])

mean = data.mean()
print("The mean is {mean:.2f}")
```

## TODO

Images, interactive graphics, svg?
